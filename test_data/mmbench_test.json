When a ruminant, such as a deer, eats food, the first two chambers of the animal's stomach extract the liquid from the food. The solid remainder of the food, known as the cud, is then regurgitated back into the animal's mouth to be chewed again. This allows the animal to extract more nutrients than it would otherwise.

        "hint": "Read the text about sloths.\nSloths are known for being one of the slowest animals on the planet. They also sleep up to twenty hours every day. Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.\nFor example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.\nSloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.\nHanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world.",

        "hint": "This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:\nMyotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.\nIn a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two goats.",

My overall impressions for the base pico 4 was good. (With VD) I heard Streaming Assistant is worse than Airlink, but it\u2019s the way to transfer face tracking data other than ALXR at this point. I genuinely believe that the panel and optics quality of the pico 4 is pretty much on par with the XR Elite. And since XR Elite uses the same headset-tracked controllers, I don\u2019t think at its current price point HTC\u2019s offering is competitive. Unless you really need the modularity and form factor. The quest pro still has its edge though. The mini led panels are brighter, more vibrant and the better image quality is even more pronounced through the crystal clear pancake optics. The facial tracking sensors are also more well-placed in the headset. Although based on my personal experience these sensors are extremely unreliable. I will see how long my third QPro will last. And the question is, the Quest Pro is better in some ways, but is it worth the $600 difference, given its horrible ergonomics and questionable quality control? \ud83e\udd28",

Logistic growth, in contrast, occurs when resources are scarce or a population faces considerable limiting factors, such as predators.

Some other mammalian species, though, are ruminants, which means that their stomachs have four chambers instead of one. Ruminants are perhaps most well-known for how much chewing they do during their digestive process. When a ruminant, such as a deer, eats food, the first two chambers of the animal's stomach extract the liquid from the food. The solid remainder of the food, known as the cud, is then regurgitated back into the animal's mouth to be chewed again. This allows the animal to extract more nutrients than it would otherwise. This is ideal for animals that eat plant-based diets, so it's no coincidence that ruminants are always herbivores.",

Decomposers, in contrast, often don't have mouths, so they must externally digest the dead organic matter. They break the matter into simpler parts, often dissolving it, and then absorb the broken-down matter. Fungi and bacteria are examples of decomposers.

Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.\nFor example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.\nSloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.\nHanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world.",

        "hint": "Before sunrise on November 14, 1963, the crew of the fishing boat Isleifur II had just finished putting their lines in the ocean off the southern coast of Iceland. As the crew waited to have breakfast, a strong smell of sulfur drifted over the boat. At first, crew members thought that the cook had burned the eggs or that something was wrong with the boat's engine. But when the sun started to rise, the crew saw black smoke billowing from the water a few kilometers away.\nThe captain of the Isleifur II assumed the smoke was coming from a boat that was on fire, so he sailed closer to try to help. As the Isleifur II approached the smoke, the surface of the sea grew rough. The captain and crew saw flashes of lightning in the column of smoke and glowing pieces of molten rock shooting up out of the water. The captain realized this was not a burning boat.

Females often groom, or clean, their eggs. The females lick their eggs and turn them over in the nest to groom them.\nWhen female earwigs groom eggs, the eggs hatch more often.

When tadpoles hatch from the eggs, the male frog lets the tadpoles climb onto his back. The male then searches for water trapped in the spaces where plants' leaves meet their stems. He puts his tadpoles in these small pools of water.\nIf the male frog puts a tadpole into a pool with a larger tadpole, the smaller tadpole is often eaten. So, the male frog usually puts each tadpole into a pool of water that does not have other tadpoles in it.

When an egg hatches, the white of the broken eggshell stands out from the brown nest. This makes it easier for crows and other predators to find the nest and eat the offspring in it.\nAfter an egg hatches, the parent gull leaves the nest to carry the broken eggshell away.

        "hint": "This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:\nMyotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.\nIn a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for having myotonia congenita (M) is dominant over the allele for not having myotonia congenita (m).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two goats.",

My overall impressions for the base pico 4 was good. (With VD) I heard Streaming Assistant is worse than Airlink, but it\u2019s the way to transfer face tracking data other than ALXR at this point. I genuinely believe that the panel and optics quality of the pico 4 is pretty much on par with the XR Elite. And since XR Elite uses the same headset-tracked controllers, I don\u2019t think at its current price point HTC\u2019s offering is competitive. Unless you really need the modularity and form factor. The quest pro still has its edge though. The mini led panels are brighter, more vibrant and the better image quality is even more pronounced through the crystal clear pancake optics. The facial tracking sensors are also more well-placed in the headset. Although based on my personal experience these sensors are extremely unreliable. I will see how long my third QPro will last. And the question is, the Quest Pro is better in some ways, but is it worth the $600 difference, given its horrible ergonomics and questionable quality control? \ud83e\udd28",

        "hint": "Read the text about sloths.\nSloths are known for being one of the slowest animals on the planet. They also sleep up to twenty hours every day. Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.\nFor example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.\nSloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.\nHanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world.",

Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.\nIn a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles.

My overall impressions for the base pico 4 was good. (With VD) I heard Streaming Assistant is worse than Airlink, but it\u2019s the way to transfer face tracking data other than ALXR at this point. I genuinely believe that the panel and optics quality of the pico 4 is pretty much on par with the XR Elite. And since XR Elite uses the same headset-tracked controllers, I don\u2019t think at its current price point HTC\u2019s offering is competitive. Unless you really need the modularity and form factor. The quest pro still has its edge though. The mini led panels are brighter, more vibrant and the better image quality is even more pronounced through the crystal clear pancake optics. The facial tracking sensors are also more well-placed in the headset. Although based on my personal experience these sensors are extremely unreliable. I will see how long my third QPro will last. And the question is, the Quest Pro is better in some ways, but is it worth the $600 difference, given its horrible ergonomics and questionable quality control? \ud83e\udd28"

Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.\nIn a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles.

My overall impressions for the base pico 4 was good. (With VD) I heard Streaming Assistant is worse than Airlink, but it\u2019s the way to transfer face tracking data other than ALXR at this point. I genuinely believe that the panel and optics quality of the pico 4 is pretty much on par with the XR Elite. And since XR Elite uses the same headset-tracked controllers, I don\u2019t think at its current price point HTC\u2019s offering is competitive. Unless you really need the modularity and form factor. The quest pro still has its edge though. The mini led panels are brighter, more vibrant and the better image quality is even more pronounced through the crystal clear pancake optics. The facial tracking sensors are also more well-placed in the headset. Although based on my personal experience these sensors are extremely unreliable. I will see how long my third QPro will last. And the question is, the Quest Pro is better in some ways, but is it worth the $600 difference, given its horrible ergonomics and questionable quality control? \ud83e\udd28",
